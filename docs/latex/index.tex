This is a simple implementation of a P\+ID controller.

The model is a simple \char`\"{}hotplate\char`\"{} simulation. I\textquotesingle{}ve tuned the P\+ID to work well for that particular simulation, but note\+: it must be manually tuned (for now) for any other application. The model seems to work best at P\+: 35.\+5 I\+: 0.\+03 D\+: 110.

The model can be ran with\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./main -p 35.5 -i 0.03 -d 110 > out.dat
gnuplot plot.gnu
\end{DoxyCode}
